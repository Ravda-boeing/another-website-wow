        <p>Here at Sri Lankan Airlines, we do our <em>very</em> best to ensure that our passengers are given the opportunity to fly world-class with this airline. On the crew side of things, Sri Lankan Airlines is operated by a host of well-poised, well-experienced staff who are ready to serve our passengers in the best way possible. Unlike other servers that cut corners on realism, we don't do that, which means we go all out on a fully flexible, fully realistic RP server.</p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Our History</h1>
        <p>**SriLankan Airlines** was launched in **1979** as **Air Lanka**, following the termination of operations of the original Sri Lankan flag carrier Air Ceylon¹. Despite the challenges faced during its early years, the airline has shown remarkable resilience and adaptability.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">How the Discord server was made</h3>
        <p>The Sri Lankan Airlines Discord server, established by That One Boeing Pilot in early July 2024...</p>
